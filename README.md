## Background

Using devices such as JawboneUp, NikeFuelBand, and Fitbitit is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Data

The data sets was originated from here: Ugulino, W.; Cardador, D.; Vega, K.; Velloso, E.; Milidiu, R.; Fuks, H. Wearable Computing: Accelerometers' Data Classification of Body Postures and Movements.

## Goal

For this project, we are given data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 research study participants. Our training data consists of accelerometer data and a label identifying the quality of the activity the participant was doing. Our testing data consists of accelerometer data without the identifying label. Our goal is to predict the labels for the test set observations.
